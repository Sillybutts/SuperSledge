# SuperSledge
A shell ejecting blaster, a good learning experience for design.

## Description

General blaster overview: 

The SuperSledge is a hobby-grade break action shell ejecting blaster, similar to the old Nerf Sledgefire.

## Hardware, Compatability, and Availability

Hardware was previously sold by CaptainSlug, but no hardware is currently being produced. The SuperSledge is basically an abandoned/finished design, and I have no plans to make hardware kits.

That being said, here's a hardware list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u4mv7_Of2lPWJnp0_FuKg_yKTyttZHyiTwWyMT9gIm0/

## Assembly

I will not be making a full assembly guide for the SuperSledge, but here's some pictures to help you figure out where to put what. 

Some glue is needed on the bit that the top lever pivots on. 

The catch and shell ejector use elastic. 

The two pins that go in slots (the priming wedge and the plunger rod) need spacers on both sides of the shell, with a printed cotter pin keeping them in place.

Print 2 SpacerA, 6 SpacerB, and 2 PlungerRodSide.
