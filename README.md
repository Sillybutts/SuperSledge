# SuperSledge
A shell ejecting blaster, a good learning experience for design.

# **THE SUPER SLEDGE IS ABANDONED. IT WAS A GREAT LEARNING EXPERIENCE AS A DESIGNER, BUT IT JUST HAS TOO MANY FUNDEMENTAL ISSUES TO BE WORTHWHILE FOR ME TO FINISH, AND I WOULDN'T BE HAPPY WITH THE FINAL RESULT EVEN IF I DID RELEASE IT PROPERLY FINISHED. SO THESE FILES ARE FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE FUN WITH, FINISH ON THEIR OWN, AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT HARDWARE KITS SO LONG AGO, NEVER ABLE TO EVEN GET A "meh" BLASTER OUT OF IT. SORRY TO YOU FOLK :(**

## Description

## Hardware, Compatability, and Availability

Hardware was previously sold by CaptainSlug, but no hardware is currently being produced. The SuperSledge is basically an abandoned/"""finished""" design, and I have no plans to make hardware kits.

That being said, here's a hardware list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u4mv7_Of2lPWJnp0_FuKg_yKTyttZHyiTwWyMT9gIm0/

Some glue is needed on the bit that the top lever pivots on. 

The catch, barrel locking lever, and shell ejector use elastic. 

The two pins that go in slots (the priming wedge and the plunger rod) need spacers on both sides of the shell, with a printed cotter pin keeping them in place.

Print 2 SpacerA, 6 SpacerB, and 2 PlungerRodSide.
